# JAVAFX POC

Hi,

For make this project work, please follow below steps

1- All code is in JAVAFX.zip file.
2- Unzip JAVAFX.zip and import it into eclipse workspace.
3- Run the application by clicking on run button in eclipse.
4- Please verify GUI and let me know your inputs. 
5- We need to change the observablelist while integrating with backend. So backend developer needs to focus only on backend part.
6- For now i kept some dummy data on observable list, which can be made dynamic by backend developer.
7- I just applied basic css on this sample. We can add as per our requirement later on.

Note - I am using java 8, so please make you are running eclipse on java 8


Thanks,
Abhishek Yadav
